Gradle file settings

Step 1: Change the View Mode
1.	In the left panel of Android Studio (where you see folders like java, res, etc.),
look at the top of that panel — there’s a dropdown (it probably says Android right now).
2.	Click that dropdown and choose “Project” instead.
3.	Now you’ll see the real folder structure of your app.
It should look like this:
YourProjectName/
├── .gradle/
├── app/
│    ├── build/
│    ├── src/
│    ├── build.gradle   (this is what we need)
├── build.gradle        X (this is the *project-level* one)
├── settings.gradle
└── gradle.properties


Step 2: Identify the Correct File
You should now see two build.gradle files:
•	One directly under your project folder → project-level
•	One inside the app folder → module-level (we want this one) ✅


Step 3: Open and Edit It
Open app/build.gradle and scroll down until you find a block that starts like this:
dependencies {
    ...
}
Now add this line inside that block:
implementation 'androidx.constraintlayout:constraintlayout:2.1.4'
Here’s how it should look:
dependencies {
    implementation 'androidx.core:core-ktx:1.10.1'
    implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.6.1'
    implementation 'com.google.android.material:material:1.9.0'
    implementation 'androidx.constraintlayout:constraintlayout:2.1.4'  // Added line
}


Step 4: Sync the Project
After editing:
•	Click “Sync Now” when prompted at the top right,
or go to File → Sync Project with Gradle Files.
